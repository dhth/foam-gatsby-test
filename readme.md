dhruv's wiki
===

My long-term goal for this wiki is to consolidate all — or atleast most! — of what I know.

Why does this exist?
---

I've been writing reasonably well maintained notes on Notion for a while now. Even though it's one of the best note taking tools out there, I didn't want to be tied down to a specific platform for my wiki. On top of that, the lack of Vim key bindings in Notion expedited the switch to simple markdown based notes.

> This wiki is still in *"construction mode"*, as there's a lot of stuff I need to port over from Notion.
